2. Test each batch before proceeding
3. Update imports in existing pages
4. Document prop interfaces for each component

## 📖 Usage Examples

### Refactored Component Usage
```tsx
// Hero108 with custom props
<Hero108 
  data={{
    title: "Custom Title",
    benefits: [
      { title: "Benefit 1", description: "Description" }
    ],
    buttonText: "Custom Button",
    buttonHref: "/custom-link"
  }} 
/>

// Stats9 with custom data
<Stats9 
  title="Custom Stats Title"
  stats={[
    { label: "Metric 1", value: "100%" },
    { label: "Metric 2", value: "50+" }
  ]}
  benefits={[
    { title: "Feature", description: "Feature description" }
  ]}
/>

// Feature187 with methodology
<Feature187 
  title="Process Steps"
  steps={[
    { title: "Step 1", description: "Step description" }
  ]}
/>
```

## 🔄 Benefits Achieved

1. **Flexibility** - Components can be customized for different use cases
2. **Reusability** - Same components work across multiple pages
3. **Maintainability** - Props make components easier to update
4. **Type Safety** - TypeScript interfaces prevent prop errors
5. **SEO Optimization** - Dynamic content improves search rankings
6. **Developer Experience** - Clear prop interfaces improve development speed

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Backwards Compatibility** - All refactored components maintain default values
2. **Gradual Migration** - Existing usages continue to work during transition
3. **Testing Required** - Each refactored component should be tested
4. **Documentation** - Update component docs with new prop interfaces
5. **Performance** - Monitor bundle size impact of type definitions

## 🚀 Automation Commands

```bash
# Run refactoring script
node scripts/refactor-components.js

# Test specific component category
npm run test -- --testPathPattern=hero

# Type check after refactoring
npm run type-check

# Build to verify no breaking changes
npm run build
```
