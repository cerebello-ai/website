As a result, citizen satisfaction improved (98% of governments say citizens prefer using new digital channels) and the municipality’s call center workload dropped significantly.
- **Computer Vision & IoT Analytics:** Leveraging AI to interpret visual data and IoT sensor streams for business insights. We create computer vision systems for tasks like image recognition, defect detection, or real-time video analytics, as well as IoT data analytics for predictive monitoring. _Use case:_ In a manufacturing setting, our team developed a computer vision solution to automatically inspect products on the assembly line for quality control. Integrating camera feeds with an AI model, the system detects defects or anomalies in real time, improving quality assurance accuracy and reducing manual inspection labor by thousands of hours annually.
- **Generative AI & AI Advisory:** Helping clients explore the frontier of AI with generative models (such as GPT-based solutions) and providing advisory on AI adoption. We can fine-tune large language models for your enterprise needs – for example, to generate marketing content, summarize reports, or assist with coding – always with appropriate governance. _Use case:_ A global consulting firm engaged Cerebello to integrate a custom GPT-based assistant into their knowledge management system. This AI assistant can draft research summaries and answer consultants’ queries by pulling from internal documents, saving each consultant several hours per week in research time while ensuring consistent, high-quality outputs.

### Process Automation

- **Robotic Process Automation (RPA):** Implementing RPA bots to automate repetitive, rule-based tasks and workflows. We analyze your business processes to identify tasks that software robots can perform faster and error-free – such as data entry, invoice processing, or HR onboarding steps. _Use case:_ A healthcare clinic had staff spending hours every day manually entering patient billing data between systems. Cerebello introduced RPA bots that now automatically transfer and validate data across the billing and insurance platforms. The clinic saw immediate benefits: processing errors dropped near zero and staff reclaimed 40% of their day to focus on patient care, reflecting how AI-driven automation cuts routine work and costs[softwareoasis.com](https://softwareoasis.com/business-process-automation/#:~:text=Efficiency%20Gains).
- **Intelligent Workflow Automation:** Going beyond basic RPA by infusing workflows with AI for decision-making and document understanding. We create **intelligent automation** pipelines that can handle unstructured inputs (like emails, PDFs) and apply AI logic to route tasks or make approvals. _Use case:_ A city government’s permit approval process was slow due to manual document checks. We implemented an intelligent workflow where incoming permit applications are scanned by an AI (using NLP to read forms and verify completeness) and then automatically routed to the appropriate officer if criteria are met. This **streamlined the permit processing time by 50%**, allowing faster response to citizens while officials focus only on the complex cases.
- **Process Optimization & Re-engineering:** Consultancy to review and redesign business processes for maximum efficiency, often in tandem with new automation. Our experts map out current workflows, identify bottlenecks, and apply lean principles and automation tech to optimize the end-to-end process. _Use case:_ An insurance company engaged Cerebello to optimize their claims handling process. We analyzed their multi-step claims workflow, eliminated redundant approvals, and introduced automation for tasks like document verification. The re-engineered process – supported by a mix of RPA and AI document classification – reduced claim settlement time from 10 days to 3 days, dramatically improving customer satisfaction.
- **Intelligent Document Processing:** Using AI to automate data extraction and processing from documents (such as invoices, contracts, forms). We deploy OCR (Optical Character Recognition) combined with machine learning to understand and digitize information from paper or PDFs, feeding it into your systems without human effort. _Use case:_ A logistics firm receives thousands of shipping documents and bills of lading. We delivered an intelligent document processing solution that reads these scanned documents, extracts key fields (dates, container numbers, fees), and enters them into the company’s database. The system handles about 85% of documents without human intervention, speeding up throughput and virtually eliminating data entry errors.

### Strategy & Consultancy

- **AI Strategy & Roadmap Consulting:** High-level consulting to formulate an AI adoption strategy aligned with your business goals. We help leadership teams identify the most valuable AI and automation opportunities, prioritize use cases, and develop a phased roadmap. This includes assessing readiness, defining KPIs, and ensuring the plan is pragmatic and ROI-driven. _Use case:_ A large **maritime shipping enterprise** asked Cerebello for an AI roadmap. Through workshops and analysis, we identified key opportunities (predictive fleet maintenance, route optimization, and demand forecasting) and created a 3-year implementation roadmap. The strategy gave the client clarity on where to invest first for quick wins versus long-term platform builds, serving as a blueprint that won board approval for a multimillion-euro digital transformation program.
- **Business Process Analysis & Reengineering:** Advisory services to evaluate existing processes and recommend improvements or automation targets. We conduct thorough process mapping and performance analysis (often in conjunction with your Lean/Six Sigma teams) to highlight inefficiencies. The outcome is a set of recommendations – perhaps to eliminate certain steps, centralize data, or apply specific technologies – along with the business case for each change. _Use case:_ A regional bank used our consulting to improve its loan approval process. Cerebello consultants mapped out the journey from application to disbursement, pinpointed delay points, and proposed a revamped process leveraging an AI credit scoring model and e-signature automation. The bank was able to cut approval times in half and handle 30% more loan volume with the same headcount after implementing our recommendations.
- **Data Strategy & Integration Consulting:** Ensuring that a client’s data foundation is ready for AI. We offer guidance on data governance, architecture, and integration needed to support advanced analytics. This can include advising on data platform setups (cloud data lakes, etc.), data quality processes, and how to break down silos between systems for a unified AI strategy. _Use case:_ A retail chain wanted to become “AI-ready.” Cerebello’s team audited their data across sales, inventory, and customer channels, and found gaps and silos. We crafted a data strategy that involved consolidating data into a cloud warehouse and implementing governance standards for data accuracy. With this foundation laid, the company successfully deployed a new AI-driven loyalty personalization program, since the underlying data was now reliable and accessible.
- **Change Management & AI Training:** Strategic support to help organizations manage the human side of adopting AI and automation. We provide training programs to upskill employees on new tools, and we work with management on change management plans to encourage user adoption and mitigate concerns. Our consultants help define new roles or workflows so that **humans and AI can work in harmony**. _Use case:_ A manufacturing firm rolling out an AI-driven planning system engaged us to facilitate change management. We ran training workshops for planners and shop-floor managers to demonstrate the new system’s capabilities, and instituted a feedback loop for employees to voice concerns. By involving end-users early and often, the firm saw enthusiastic adoption of the AI tool rather than resistance. This approach mirrors a broader trend – companies that introduce AI in a way that empowers employees (not threatens them) achieve smoother transitions and better outcomes

### Integrations & Custom Development

- **Enterprise System Integration:** Connecting AI and automation solutions with clients’ existing IT systems (ERP, CRM, databases, legacy software). We specialize in **seamlessly integrating** new tools into the current technology stack, ensuring data flows and processes remain smooth. This often involves developing APIs, middleware, or adapters so that, for example, an AI model’s output can directly update your ERP records. _Use case:_ A municipal government implemented a new AI analytics dashboard for city data but needed it to pull information from legacy databases. Cerebello stepped in to integrate the dashboard with their old SQL database and document management system. Our integration allowed real-time data syncing, so city officials could see up-to-date insights without manual data transfers – overcoming a typical hurdle where many organizations struggle to make modern AI work with older systems[softwareoasis.com](https://softwareoasis.com/business-process-automation/#:~:text=Despite%20its%20benefits%2C%20businesses%20face,hurdles%20when%20adopting%20BPA).
- **Custom Software Development:** Building bespoke software applications and tools (beyond just AI models) to support automation and unique business needs. Sometimes off-the-shelf software doesn’t fit a specific requirement – our development team can create tailored web or mobile applications, internal dashboards, or microservices that fill the gap. _Use case:_ A healthcare provider wanted a unified workflow tool to manage patient referrals between departments – no vendor product did exactly what they needed. We developed a custom web application that integrates with their existing electronic health record system, routing referrals automatically and alerting the right staff. The solution was not strictly “AI”, but it was critical to automating their process. This flexibility to develop custom software as needed ensures clients get the _complete_ solution, not just pieces.
- **Third-Party Integrations & API Orchestration:** Many clients leverage popular platforms (Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, etc.) – we help extend and connect these platforms using their APIs and by integrating AI capabilities. Cerebello can, for example, integrate a Salesforce CRM with an AI lead scoring service, or connect an RPA bot to a finance system. We also design **orchestration layers** that coordinate multiple bots, AI services, and applications into one cohesive workflow. _Use case:_ An e-commerce company needed their order management system to work with a new AI inventory optimizer. We built an integration where the AI’s restocking recommendations automatically flow into their SAP system for approval and execution. By stitching together the AI service with SAP via API calls, we saved the operations team from manually transferring data. This “stitching together” of proven tools is increasingly what businesses prefer – it shortens project timelines and lowers risk by not reinventing the wheel[cruxdigits.nl](https://www.cruxdigits.nl/blog/ai-consulting-trends-and-predictions-2025/#:~:text=While%20building%20AI%20systems%20from,cloud%20solutions%2C%20and%20legacy%20systems), and Cerebello has embraced this integration-first approach.
- **Cloud & IoT Integration:** Assisting clients in connecting cloud services and Internet of Things devices into their automated workflows. We ensure that IoT sensor data pipelines, cloud AI services (like AWS, Azure AI tools), and on-premise systems all communicate securely and efficiently. _Use case:_ A farming enterprise uses IoT sensors in the field and wanted to integrate that data with a cloud AI service for crop analytics. We set up a data integration pipeline where sensor readings stream to an Azure cloud database, an AI model analyzes crop health, and the insights are fed into the farmer’s dashboard app. This end-to-end integration allows real-time field monitoring and alerts for irrigation or fertilizer needs, demonstrating how connecting IoT and AI yields intelligent automation in even traditional sectors.

Each of these services is delivered with Cerebello’s hallmark emphasis on quality, security, and knowledge transfer. We typically begin engagements with a discovery phase to understand client needs, then proceed to solution design, iterative development, rigorous testing, and deployment – all while coordinating closely with client teams. Our ultimate goal is to **deliver solutions that not only fit perfectly into your operations but also deliver outsized returns on efficiency, accuracy, and agility.**

_(Industry statistics: AI and automation have been shown to boost productivity and reduce errors significantly – for example, automation can cut operational costs by 15% or more and improve customer satisfaction by around 7% through error reduction[softwareoasis.com](https://softwareoasis.com/business-process-automation/#:~:text=1,Gitnux%20Report%20via%20Capgemini%20Study). Cerebello’s service offerings are aligned with these proven benefits, ensuring our clients capture such gains in their own context.)_

## Example Use Case / Client Scenario

To illustrate how Cerebello works in practice, consider the following **client scenario** that ties together our offerings:

**Client:** _OceanicTransCo_, a large maritime shipping and logistics company with global operations (an established enterprise in the maritime industry).

**Problem:** OceanicTransCo was facing several challenges:

- **Unexpected equipment failures** on their cargo ships were causing costly delays. Reactive maintenance meant ships sometimes went out of service suddenly, throwing off schedules.
- **Inefficient route planning** led to longer voyages and higher fuel consumption. The company relied on manual route decisions that didn’t always account for real-time data like weather or port congestion.
- **Heavy paperwork** and manual processing of shipping documents (manifests, customs forms) burdened their staff. Different IT systems in operations and finance weren’t well integrated, so employees spent hours re-entering data and reconciling information, which introduced errors.

These issues resulted in higher operating costs, unhappy customers (due to delays), and overworked staff. OceanicTransCo’s leadership knew that AI and automation might solve these problems but lacked a clear plan and in-house expertise to implement such solutions.

**Proposed Solution:** OceanicTransCo engaged **Cerebello** to design and implement a comprehensive AI-powered automation program. Our team formulated a solution that addressed each pain point in an integrated way:

1. **AI-driven Predictive Maintenance:** We deployed a predictive maintenance system across the fleet. This involved installing IoT sensors on critical ship components (engines, fuel systems) and streaming the data into a cloud platform. Cerebello’s data scientists developed machine learning models to analyze sensor patterns and predict equipment failures **before** they happen. By scheduling maintenance proactively based on AI insights, the company could avoid breakdowns. (Notably, predictive maintenance can _eliminate up to 70% of breakdowns_ in heavy equipment, a statistic we shared to build confidence in this approach.)
2. **Route Optimization with AI:** Our team integrated a route optimization tool that uses AI algorithms to calculate the most efficient shipping routes. It considers weather forecasts, sea conditions, port traffic, and historical voyage data to recommend optimal paths and speeds. According to McKinsey research, AI-based route optimization can **reduce fuel consumption by up to 15%** while cutting travel time by 20% For OceanicTransCo, we tailored the solution to their operations: the AI suggests routes for each voyage, which planners can approve or adjust. Over time, the AI learns from actual outcomes to improve recommendations continuously.
3. **Process Automation & System Integration:** Cerebello addressed the document workflow by introducing a degree of **process automation** and custom integration software. We built a module that automatically digitizes and processes shipping documents: when a ship arrives at port, staff scan the necessary forms, an AI-powered OCR extracts the data, and the system populates both the logistics system and the finance system with that information. We integrated this module with OceanicTransCo’s legacy enterprise systems (with which they manage cargo tracking and billing) so that data flows seamlessly – eliminating duplicate data entry. Additionally, an RPA bot was configured to handle routine data reconciliation between the freight management system and the accounting ledger, flagging any inconsistencies for human review rather than requiring full manual checks.

**Process:** The engagement followed a structured path:

- _Discovery & Planning:_ Cerebello consultants spent time onsite to understand OceanicTransCo’s processes, IT landscape, and specific challenges. We conducted workshops with their operations team, maintenance engineers, and IT department. In this phase, we quantified the impact of issues (e.g., how many breakdowns per year, average delay hours, fuel costs, etc.) and set clear success metrics for the project (such as “reduce unplanned downtime by X%” or “cut fuel cost per voyage by Y%”).
- _Prototype & Pilot:_ We initiated a pilot on a subset of the fleet – equipping two ships with the predictive maintenance sensors and AI, and testing the route optimization on a few key routes. We also trialed the document automation on one shipping lane’s paperwork. This pilot allowed us to validate the technology in real operating conditions and gather feedback from OceanicTransCo’s staff (e.g., ship engineers’ feedback on the maintenance alerts, or planners’ input on route suggestions). Early results were promising – within months, the two pilot ships experienced **zero unexpected breakdowns** (compared to an average of 2 incidents in the same period historically), and fuel usage on optimized routes dropped noticeably.
- _Full-Scale Implementation:_ With pilot success and stakeholder buy-in, we rolled out the solutions company-wide. Cerebello’s engineers worked in cross-functional teams with the client’s IT and operations folks to deploy sensors on all 50 ships in the fleet and connect them to the cloud AI platform. We integrated our route AI tool into the company’s voyage planning software, so planners saw AI suggestions in their existing interface – making adoption easier. The document processing module was rolled out to all regional offices. Throughout this phase, we conducted training sessions: teaching maintenance crews how to interpret and act on AI-generated maintenance alerts, training planners on the new routing dashboard, and training clerical staff on exception handling for the automated document system.
- _Monitoring & Support:_ After go-live, Cerebello remained engaged to monitor system performance and ensure a smooth transition. We set up dashboards for OceanicTransCo’s managers to track key metrics (downtime, fuel consumption, processing time per shipment, etc.). We also established an ongoing support agreement – our team would quarterly review the predictive model’s accuracy and retrain it as needed with new data, and fine-tune the route optimization as shipping patterns or seasons changed. Essentially, we helped the client develop internal capability to sustain these AI solutions, while providing expert support during the early stage of adoption.

**Outcomes:** The transformation for OceanicTransCo was significant:

- _Reduced Downtime:_ Unplanned maintenance incidents fell dramatically. In the first year after implementation, the company observed a **60% reduction in unexpected breakdowns** in their fleet. This aligned with industry benchmarks that predictive maintenance can reduce equipment breakdowns by 50–70%. Fewer breakdowns meant more ships stayed on schedule, improving reliability of deliveries.
- _Cost Savings and Efficiency:_ The AI-optimized routing led to a substantial cut in fuel usage – on average **12% fuel savings per voyage**, translating to millions of dollars saved annually, given fuel is a major cost driver. Voyage durations also shortened, allowing the company to potentially fit extra trips into the year. The maintenance AI optimized the parts replacement schedules, which **lowered maintenance costs by about 20%** (by avoiding unnecessary routine checks and focusing on condition-based maintenance). Administrative labor was reallocated: the automated document processing saved an estimated 15,000 employee hours per year that were previously spent on paperwork. Overall, OceanicTransCo achieved an estimated **ROI of over 200% in the first year** from the combined initiatives – essentially the project paid for itself multiple times over, a result not uncommon as organizations implementing RPA/AI often see ROI improvements between 30% and 200% in year one.
- _Improved Service & Capacity:_ With more reliable schedules and faster turnaround, OceanicTransCo was able to improve its customer satisfaction. Clients reported better on-time delivery rates. Internally, the operations team noted that with the efficiency gains, they could handle more shipments without additional resources – effectively **increasing capacity by ~10-15%**. The company even leveraged the newfound efficiencies as a marketing point, positioning itself as a tech-driven shipping partner.
- _Empowered Employees:_ Initially, there was some apprehension among staff about the new systems (for example, ship engineers worried the AI might overrule their judgement, or back-office staff worried about job security). However, because Cerebello and OceanicTransCo’s management proactively managed this change – involving employees early, providing training, and clarifying that the technology was there to assist them – the workforce adapted well. Engineers came to trust the AI maintenance alerts (which often caught issues they might have missed until much later), and planners appreciated the AI’s ability to crunch data for routing while they applied the final human judgment. By the end of the project, the culture had shifted to one of **human-AI collaboration**, with employees feeling augmented by the new tools rather than threatened. This outcome was by design: we aligned the implementation with best practices for introducing AI in ways that _empower_ employees, ensuring the human element was respected throughout.

**Conclusion of Scenario:** In this example, _Cerebello_ helped a traditional industry player become smarter and more agile through AI and automation. OceanicTransCo’s journey—from identifying problems to implementing AI solutions at scale—highlights our role as a trusted partner in digital transformation. We combined **multiple service areas (strategy, AI solutions, process automation, and integration)** in one cohesive program. The success of the project was evident in quantifiable performance metrics and in the client’s enhanced capabilities. Today, OceanicTransCo continues to work with Cerebello for ongoing improvements and new projects (such as exploring AI for demand forecasting to optimize fleet allocation), demonstrating the long-term partnership approach we strive for.
