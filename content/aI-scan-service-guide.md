## Overview

Cerebello’s **AI Scan** is a focused assessment service that evaluates your organization’s operations and data to uncover opportunities for AI-driven automation and improvement. In essence, we “scan” your business processes and technology landscape to identify where artificial intelligence and automation can deliver the most value. This matters because AI adoption is becoming crucial for competitiveness – for example, about **66% of companies have automated at least one process by 2024**, and **75% of executives say AI has improved decision-making and given them a competitive edge**. An AI Scan helps ensure you are not left behind by systematically finding high-impact use cases for AI in your business. Cerebello approaches this in a professional yet approachable way, acting as a **trusted partner** to guide you toward smarter workflows and innovation. We combine cutting-edge AI insight with practical business sense, so the recommendations are intelligent but accessible and aligned with your goals.

## Methodology

Our AI Scan follows a clear, phased methodology. We work closely with your team through each step to ensure a thorough and collaborative assessment:

- **Discovery Phase:** This initial phase is all about understanding your business. We begin with information gathering – conducting stakeholder interviews, workshops, and reviewing relevant documentation to grasp your current processes, pain points, and objectives. The Cerebello team spends time learning about your operations and IT landscape in depth, because a solution is only as good as our understanding of the problem.

- **Analysis Phase:** Next, our experts analyze the findings to spot where AI or automation could make a difference. We identify specific **AI opportunities** and **process improvement areas**, then **prioritize use cases** where AI can deliver the most immediate value or solve critical challenges. This often involves brainstorming sessions and leveraging our industry experience to imagine AI solutions, then evaluating each idea’s feasibility and potential impact. We may use tools like an _impact/feasibility matrix_ to rank ideas – mapping use cases by business impact and technical ease of implementation. The goal is to separate “quick wins” from more complex, long-term initiatives in a transparent way.

- **Reporting Phase:** Finally, we synthesize the insights into a clear set of recommendations. Cerebello will **deliver an executive-ready report and presentation** that summarizes our findings, including key pain points, identified AI use cases, and a proposed roadmap. In a readout session, we walk your stakeholders through the results, using plain language and visual aids. The report includes actionable insights and a step-by-step plan for implementation – essentially a strategic AI roadmap – so you know **what to do next** to realize the opportunities. We make sure to define measurable KPIs and quick-start projects, giving you a pragmatic plan that fits your budget and capacity.

Throughout these phases, Cerebello’s approach is **collaborative and transparent**. We keep you involved via regular check-ins or workshops (for example, an interactive use-case brainstorming workshop). This ensures that the AI Scan’s recommendations are not done _to_ you but _with_ you – aligning with your business priorities and building buy-in from your team.

## Timeline & Deliverables

**Typical Duration:** An AI Scan engagement is relatively quick compared to full implementation projects. The timeline can vary based on scope, but on average a comprehensive scan takes around **4–6 weeks from kickoff to final report**. In simpler cases (for a specific process or department), it might be as short as 2–3 weeks, whereas a broader multi-department assessment could extend to \~8 weeks. We tailor the schedule to your availability – usually starting with a kickoff workshop in week 1, analysis in weeks 2–3, and final results presentation by week 4–6. This agile timeframe means you get actionable insights fast, without a long wait.

**Deliverables:** By the end of the AI Scan, you will receive a package of deliverables that provides both **big-picture strategy and concrete details**. Our standard deliverables include:

- **AI Scan Report:** A detailed written report (often \~20-30 pages) documenting our findings. This includes an executive summary of key insights, analysis of current state, identified AI use cases with their expected benefits, and our recommendations. It is designed to be easy to skim for high-level takeaways, while also providing deeper analysis in the appendices for technical readers.
- **Presentation & Readout:** We provide a slide deck highlighting the main findings and the proposed roadmap, which we will present to your team (in person or virtually). This presentation distills the report into a concise, visual format for decision-makers. It typically features charts and graphs to illustrate opportunities, before/after scenarios, and a timeline for implementation phases.
- **Actionable Roadmap:** As part of the deliverables (often included in the report or as its own section), we outline a phased **AI roadmap**. This roadmap prioritizes initiatives (e.g. “Phase 1: Quick win chatbot in customer service; Phase 2: predictive analytics for supply chain…”) with suggested timelines. It serves as a practical plan that you can use to proceed with implementing the AI solutions. The roadmap is phased to balance quick wins and longer-term projects, giving you a clear strategy for the next 6, 12, or 24 months.
- **Supplementary Materials:** If applicable, we also hand over any supporting materials from the assessment – for example, process maps we created, data audit results, or workshop notes. These are provided so that your team has full transparency and can reference the analysis behind our recommendations.

In summary, you receive a **comprehensive analysis package**: a written report, a management presentation, and a concrete plan of action. These deliverables equip your team with everything needed to move forward confidently – you can present the findings to executives, kick off implementation projects, or use our roadmap as the blueprint for your AI adoption journey.

## Technical Prerequisites

To ensure a smooth AI Scan, a few prerequisites and inputs are needed from the client side. Cerebello will work with you beforehand to make sure we have the necessary access and information. Key prerequisites include:

- **Stakeholder Availability:** Plan to involve key stakeholders and subject matter experts during the discovery phase. We will need to schedule interviews or meetings with people who understand your processes (e.g. department heads, IT managers, process owners). Their insights are crucial for us to capture requirements and pain points. Having leadership support and engagement from day one also helps ensure the assessment’s success.
- **Process and System Documentation:** Gather any existing documentation that maps out your business processes, workflows, or system architecture. For example, process flowcharts, SOPs, or descriptions of IT systems in use (ERP, CRM, databases) are extremely helpful. These documents give our team a head start in understanding your environment. If no formal documentation exists, don’t worry – our discovery workshops will create a shared understanding, but any reference materials you have can save time.
- **Data Access (Read-Only):** Identify what data sources might be relevant to the AI Scan and arrange at least read-only access to sample data. Depending on the focus, this could include datasets like transaction logs, customer service transcripts, operational metrics, or even example documents (invoices, forms) that we might analyze. We take data privacy seriously and can work with anonymized or sample data if needed. The goal is to evaluate data quality and availability for AI purposes. _For instance, if we are assessing an AI solution for invoice processing, having a batch of sample invoices and how they’re processed today will let us evaluate how an AI OCR tool could fit in._
- **Systems/Environment Access:** In some cases, our team might request temporary access to certain systems or a demo environment. This could be to observe how a process is currently performed in your software (for example, watching how an employee inputs an order into a system) to better understand integration points. Any such access would be coordinated with your IT for security and scheduled so as not to disrupt operations. Often, screen-sharing sessions can suffice if direct login access is not preferred.
- **Technical Point of Contact:** It’s beneficial to designate an internal technical liaison (such as an IT manager or data engineer) who can assist with queries during the Scan. This person can help locate the right data, explain legacy system quirks, or expedite any access requests. Having a go-to contact ensures that if any technical obstacles arise, we can resolve them quickly together.

In short, **our team does most of the heavy lifting**, but your preparation and support in providing information will accelerate the process. Prior to kickoff, we’ll provide a checklist of requested data or access, and we’ll ensure NDAs and security protocols are in place so your information remains confidential. With cooperation on these prerequisites, the AI Scan can be conducted efficiently and yield more accurate insights.

## Sample Outputs

What does an AI Scan actually produce? Here we describe some sample outputs and artifacts you can expect to see in the final report and presentation:

- **Visual Charts and Graphs:** We believe in making the findings easy to grasp at a glance. Expect to see charts that illustrate the current state and the potential improvements. For example, we might include a bar chart comparing manual process times vs. projected times after automation, or a pie chart breakdown of error rates before and after an AI solution. We also often provide an **Impact/Feasibility matrix** chart for the identified use cases. This two-axis chart plots each potential AI use case (initiative) based on its estimated business impact and the feasibility (ease or complexity of implementation). This visual helps highlight “quick wins” (high impact, easy to do) versus longer-term strategic projects (high impact but more complex). It’s a great tool for stakeholders to see why we prioritized certain recommendations first.
- **Use Case Map / Opportunity List:** A core output of the scan is a well-defined list of AI **use cases** tailored to your business. In the report, each use case is typically described in a consistent format – e.g., “Use Case #1: AI-powered Customer Support Chatbot – **Opportunity:** reduce response times and workload on support team; **Solution:** implement an NLP chatbot for Tier-1 queries; **Expected Benefit:** 24/7 service, 30% fewer support tickets to humans; **Feasibility:** High (existing chatbot platforms can be adopted).” We sometimes present this as a _use case map_ or table that shows all identified opportunities along with key info like estimated cost, benefit, and timeline. This helps you easily scan which opportunities were found in each department (for instance, you might see opportunities grouped by Sales, Operations, Finance, etc. in a summary table).
- **Process Flow Illustrations:** For more complex recommended solutions, we may include simplified process flow diagrams. These illustrate how the process works **before** and **after** the proposed AI intervention. For example, if one recommendation is to use AI for document processing, we might draw a workflow showing “Document received ➜ OCR scans the document ➜ Data is extracted and sent to System A and B ➜ exceptions are flagged for review”. Such diagrams make it clear how the pieces fit together. They are useful for both technical teams and business stakeholders to visualize the future state with AI.
- **AI Readiness Scorecard:** As part of evaluating your current state, we sometimes produce an “AI readiness” or maturity scorecard. This is a concise assessment of how prepared your organization is to implement AI, across dimensions like data quality, skills, and infrastructure. It might be presented as a scored checklist or traffic-light rating (e.g., Data Quality: Green – good data available; Infrastructure: Yellow – some upgrades needed; Talent: Red – team needs training in AI). This helps identify any foundational gaps to address. It’s not meant as a judgment, but rather to ensure any recommended solution is grounded in reality – if the scorecard finds, say, data issues, our roadmap will include steps to fix that.
- **Opportunity Assessment Documents:** For each high-priority opportunity, you will see a mini “assessment” write-up. Think of this as a one-pager (or slide) per use case that digs a bit deeper into that opportunity. It typically covers the business case (why it’s valuable), solution approach (how AI would be applied), any prerequisites (e.g. “needs CRM data to be consolidated first”), and an estimate of ROI or benefit. We include these so that if you decide to pursue that use case, you already have a starting blueprint. These assessments often come with any relevant data analysis we did – for instance, if we analyzed 3 months of helpdesk tickets and found 40% are repetitive FAQs, that data point will be in the customer service chatbot opportunity page to justify the recommendation.
- **Roadmap Timeline:** As mentioned in Deliverables, a timeline view is usually provided. This could be a Gantt-chart style timeline or simply a phased list. It will show when each initiative could kick off and roughly how long it might take or what quarter/year it fits into. This helps in planning and ensures the sequence of projects makes sense (e.g., foundational projects first, quick wins early to show results, etc.). We often align this with budget cycles or strategic milestones you’ve shared. The roadmap is an output you can tweak over time – it’s meant to be a living guide, not a rigid plan.

All these outputs are designed to be **client-friendly**. We avoid jargon in the final deliverables and focus on clarity. The visuals and maps make it easy for non-technical stakeholders to understand the recommendations, while the detailed analyses satisfy the technical folks that due diligence was done. Ultimately, the **AI Scan deliverables give you both a high-level vision and a ground-level action plan** for adopting AI, backed by data and illustrations that underscore the value.

## Case Snapshot

To bring the service to life, here’s a brief example of a successful AI Scan in action. _(Note: This example is based on a common client scenario, with details simplified for illustration.)_

**Client:** _OceanicTransCo_, a large international shipping and logistics company.
**Situation:** OceanicTransCo was experiencing operational inefficiencies on multiple fronts. Their cargo ships suffered **unexpected equipment failures** (leading to costly delays due to reactive maintenance). Route planning was done manually by planners, often resulting in **suboptimal routes** that increased fuel consumption and transit times. Additionally, the company dealt with mountains of **paperwork** – shipping manifests and customs forms were processed by hand, causing slow administrative cycles and data entry errors. Leadership sensed that AI and automation could help, but they lacked a clear plan and weren’t sure where to start.

**AI Scan Solution:** OceanicTransCo engaged Cerebello for an AI Scan. Over a 5-week period, our team performed a thorough assessment:

- In the discovery phase, we mapped out the maintenance process, voyage planning workflow, and document handling steps, talking to engineers, route planners, and back-office staff. The pain points were quantified (e.g. average **X** breakdowns per month, Y hours spent on forms, etc.).
- During analysis, we identified **three high-impact AI initiatives**: (1) **AI-driven predictive maintenance** for the ships’ engines and critical parts, (2) **AI-based route optimization** using real-time data (weather, port traffic) to suggest efficient routes, and (3) **Intelligent document processing** to automate the scanning and data entry of shipping documents. These were prioritized as they directly addressed the client’s biggest costs and delays.
- We delivered a roadmap that laid out a phased implementation of these solutions. Importantly, we recommended starting with small pilots for each initiative to prove value. OceanicTransCo’s leadership received a clear picture of how these AI solutions would roll out over 3 years, what investment would be needed, and what benefits to expect.

**Results:** The AI Scan findings galvanized the client to act. They approved a **multi-million euro AI transformation program** based on our roadmap. Early pilot implementations validated the impact: for example, two ships equipped with the new predictive maintenance system experienced **zero unexpected breakdowns**, whereas historically the fleet would have seen a few failures in that period (a \~60% reduction in unplanned downtime). The AI route optimization on selected voyages cut fuel use by about **12% per trip** on average, saving millions in fuel costs annually when scaled up. Employees also saw improvements – the automation of document processing reduced manual data entry work by an estimated 85%, allowing staff to focus on more value-added tasks. This case showcases how an AI Scan not only identified _what_ to do, but set the stage for a successful execution. The client moved from uncertainty about AI to having a concrete, evidence-based strategy that delivered tangible results within months, and a long-term plan for sustained improvement.

_(This snapshot illustrates the kind of outcomes AI Scan aims for – aligning AI opportunities with business value, and creating a roadmap that leads to real-world improvements.)_

## Pricing & Cost Factors

_Cerebello’s AI Scan service is customized to each client, and pricing will depend on the scope and complexity of the engagement._ However, to provide a general idea, **we offer fixed-fee engagements** for AI Scan projects, scoped to your needs. Below are example pricing guidelines and factors:

- **Typical Range:** For a standard AI Scan focusing on a few key processes or a mid-sized business unit, the investment usually falls in the **low five-figure range (USD)**. In industry terms, a **small AI strategy assessment might cost roughly \$5,000–\$25,000**, while a more extensive enterprise-wide analysis can be higher. Many initial AI opportunity scans end up around **\$7,000 to \$35,000** as a project fee. This covers the full engagement from discovery through final report. (For reference, these figures align with typical consulting rates in the market for similar services.)
- **What’s Included:** Our pricing for an AI Scan is usually all-inclusive – it covers the consulting team’s time on research, workshops, analysis, and preparation of deliverables. Any travel costs (if on-site visits are needed) or special data processing needs would be discussed upfront. We typically quote a fixed price based on estimated effort so you have cost certainty.
- **Factors Affecting Cost:** The breadth and depth of the assessment are the biggest cost drivers. A **focused 2-week scan of a single department** (e.g., analyzing just the customer service operation for AI opportunities) will be on the lower end cost-wise. A **comprehensive 6-week scan covering multiple business units or complex processes** will naturally cost more. Specific factors include:
  - _Number of processes/areas covered:_ More departments or processes to analyze means more interviews and analysis, affecting scope.
  - _Data complexity:_ If your data is very complex or requires extensive wrangling (e.g., dozens of data sources to evaluate), it can add effort.
  - _On-site vs. remote:_ We can conduct the AI Scan entirely remotely, but if extensive on-site workshops across locations are desired, travel time/cost might be a factor.
  - _Speed:_ Occasionally clients need an accelerated turnaround (e.g., a crash 1-week assessment). We can accommodate rush timelines, but it may require a larger team and thus higher cost in a short burst.
  - _Follow-on support:_ The AI Scan itself culminates in recommendations. If you immediately want help with next steps (like prototyping a quick win use case), we can bundle some of that advisory time, which would reflect in pricing.

We strive to make the **pricing transparent and fair**. Before starting, we’ll provide a detailed proposal outlining the scope of work and a fixed price or range. As a boutique consultancy, Cerebello is flexible – we can scale the engagement size to fit your budget, whether it’s a high-level 1-week audit or an in-depth analysis. Also, note that the **value** uncovered by an AI Scan often far exceeds its cost: even one identified automation opportunity can potentially save tens of thousands annually in efficiency gains or new revenue. We’re happy to discuss cost-benefit examples relevant to your industry. **Ultimately, our goal is to ensure the AI Scan delivers a strong ROI for your business.**

_(Optional pricing note: The above figures are illustrative; please contact us for a tailored quote. We can adjust the engagement to meet both your strategic needs and budget constraints.)_
