Case Study: Ziggo – AI-Powered Process Automation in Telecom

**Client:** Ziggo, one of the largest telecommunications providers in the Netherlands.

**Problem:** Ziggo’s operations teams were experiencing bottlenecks across customer service, contract processing, and internal reporting. Manual document handling and disconnected data systems resulted in delays and inconsistent customer experiences. The customer support center faced long handling times and backlogs, and there was no intelligent triage system for routing customer emails or form submissions. Meanwhile, internal departments like Legal and Billing relied on slow, paper-heavy processes for approvals and reconciliation.

**Solution:** Cerebello deployed an integrated AI-powered automation suite:

- **Customer Support AI Triage:** Natural language processing models were introduced to classify and route incoming customer messages from email and web forms. The system automatically identified billing, technical, or cancellation issues and routed them to the correct support team, significantly reducing first-response times.

- **Intelligent Document Processing (IDP):** Cerebello implemented an OCR and ML pipeline to automate data extraction from contracts, invoices, and service agreements. These documents were digitized, parsed, and automatically stored or forwarded for approval.

- **Legal Workflow Automation:** For the legal team, Cerebello designed a smart intake tool that classified internal requests (e.g. for contract reviews or regulatory assessments) and matched them with the right legal expert, ensuring timely and compliant review cycles.

- **Operations Dashboard:** A real-time performance dashboard was built for Ziggo leadership to track automation outcomes and flag bottlenecks in customer service or contract processing.

**Process:** After discovery sessions with Ziggo’s IT and operations leads, Cerebello executed a phased rollout. Each department received a tailored implementation plan, with measurable KPIs and adoption support. Legacy systems were integrated via APIs, and all automations were designed to maintain GDPR compliance.

**Outcomes:**

- 40% faster average response time for customer inquiries.
- Over 60% of contract processing time eliminated through automation.
- Improved internal SLA compliance for legal and billing workflows.
- Higher customer satisfaction and lower operational cost.

This case highlights Cerebello’s ability to bring real, measurable improvements to telecom operations through modular AI and automation – all while working within the constraints of legacy systems and strict compliance standards.
