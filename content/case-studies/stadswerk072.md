## Case Study: Stadswerk072 – Smart Public Services with AI

**Client:** Stadswerk072, the municipal service organization for the city of Alkmaar.

**Problem:** As a local government body, Stadswerk072 manages everything from waste collection and green space maintenance to infrastructure reporting and resident inquiries. The organization faced rising workloads and limited resources. Citizen service requests came in via multiple channels (email, phone, web forms) and were routed manually, often leading to delays. Administrative staff also spent significant time logging, categorizing, and forwarding reports or documents. The organization sought a way to improve responsiveness and better serve residents—without increasing headcount.

**Solution:** Cerebello partnered with Stadswerk072 to implement AI-driven automation across key workflows:

- **AI Chatbot and Email Classifier:** A bilingual AI assistant was deployed on the municipal website and email system to handle routine citizen queries, classify messages (e.g., waste pickup, pothole report, noise complaint), and route them automatically to the right department.

- **Maintenance Report Automation:** Residents submitting public space issues (e.g., broken streetlights, overflowing trash bins) through a form or chatbot triggered an AI-powered ticketing system that generated a work order and assigned it to the correct field team.

- **Internal Document Automation:** Cerebello implemented an intelligent document reader to automatically extract relevant information from scanned forms or PDFs (e.g. permit applications or internal memos), streamlining internal processing and reducing data entry.

**Process:** The implementation began with a quick-win pilot on waste management requests. After proven success, the system was expanded to cover green space maintenance, noise complaints, and public repairs. All solutions were designed to be easy for non-technical staff to use, with governance tools in place to review and adjust automation flows as needed.

**Outcomes:**

- 70% of routine citizen queries were handled autonomously by the AI chatbot or email classifier.
- Staff hours saved on triage and form processing were reallocated to more complex, resident-facing tasks.
- Resident satisfaction scores improved due to faster response and issue resolution.
- Field teams received more accurate and complete work orders, reducing repeat visits.

This project demonstrates Cerebello’s ability to help local governments scale their citizen services through smart automation—enhancing both operational efficiency and the public experience while keeping costs predictable and data handling compliant.

**Client:** Ziggo, one of the largest telecommunications providers in the Netherlands.

**Problem:** Ziggo’s operations teams were experiencing bottlenecks across customer service, contract processing, and internal reporting. Manual document handling and disconnected data systems resulted in delays and inconsistent customer experiences. The customer support center faced long handling times and backlogs, and there was no intelligent triage system for routing customer emails or form submissions. Meanwhile, internal departments like Legal and Billing relied on slow, paper-heavy processes for approvals and reconciliation.

**Solution:** Cerebello deployed an integrated AI-powered automation suite:

- **Customer Support AI Triage:** Natural language processing models were introduced to classify and route incoming customer messages from email and web forms. The system automatically identified billing, technical, or cancellation issues and routed them to the correct support team, significantly reducing first-response times.

- **Intelligent Document Processing (IDP):** Cerebello implemented an OCR and ML pipeline to automate data extraction from contracts, invoices, and service agreements. These documents were digitized, parsed, and automatically stored or forwarded for approval.

- **Legal Workflow Automation:** For the legal team, Cerebello designed a smart intake tool that classified internal requests (e.g. for contract reviews or regulatory assessments) and matched them with the right legal expert, ensuring timely and compliant review cycles.

- **Operations Dashboard:** A real-time performance dashboard was built for Ziggo leadership to track automation outcomes and flag bottlenecks in customer service or contract processing.

**Process:** After discovery sessions with Ziggo’s IT and operations leads, Cerebello executed a phased rollout. Each department received a tailored implementation plan, with measurable KPIs and adoption support. Legacy systems were integrated via APIs, and all automations were designed to maintain GDPR compliance.

**Outcomes:**

- 40% faster average response time for customer inquiries.
- Over 60% of contract processing time eliminated through automation.
- Improved internal SLA compliance for legal and billing workflows.
- Higher customer satisfaction and lower operational cost.

This case highlights Cerebello’s ability to bring real, measurable improvements to telecom operations through modular AI and automation – all while working within the constraints of legacy systems and strict compliance standards.
