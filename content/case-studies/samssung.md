**Client:** _Samsung_, a global leader in technology and electronics.

**Problem:** Samsung faced major communication and operational inefficiencies due to email overload across departments. Sensitive internal data prevented the use of cloud-based AI solutions. Customer Support, Legal, R\&D, and Marketing teams all needed better tools to handle repetitive email tasks, extract insights, and speed up decision-making—while keeping all data securely on-premise.

**Solution:** Cerebello developed a **custom on-premise email platform enhanced with AI**, designed to integrate seamlessly into Samsung’s existing IT infrastructure. Each department received tailored modules:

- **Customer Support:** AI classified incoming emails by topic and urgency, auto-suggested replies, and routed messages to the right teams—cutting response time and agent workload by over 50%.
- **Legal:** AI analyzed contract attachments, flagged key clauses, and tagged legal inquiries for review—streamlining intake and reducing risk.
- **R\&D:** Long email threads were automatically summarized, action items extracted, and related issues clustered—helping teams track discussions and spot trends.
- **Marketing:** AI categorized campaign feedback emails by sentiment and theme—allowing real-time insight into customer perception and faster campaign tweaks.

**Process:** Cerebello led discovery workshops, built the AI-enhanced mail client, and deployed it across departments via an agile, iterative rollout. All AI models were trained on Samsung’s internal data and kept fully on-premise, ensuring data privacy and compliance.

**Outcomes:**

- Samsung’s teams significantly reduced time spent on repetitive email tasks.
- Critical issues were prioritized and addressed faster.
- Employee satisfaction improved thanks to AI support, not replacement.
- Sensitive communications stayed within Samsung’s secure infrastructure.

This project illustrates how Cerebello combines strategy, software, and AI to deliver high-impact, secure, and department-specific automation solutions for large enterprise clients.
