# Intelligent Document Processing (IDP)

## Overview

Cerebello’s Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) service uses advanced OCR, machine learning (ML), and natural language processing (NLP) to automatically extract, classify, and process data from both structured and unstructured documents – from standardized forms and invoices to free-form contracts, emails, and reports. By digitizing information directly from PDFs or scanned papers, the IDP solution eliminates tedious manual data entry, improving accuracy and accelerating document-driven workflows. The extracted data is immediately routed into your business systems or databases, ready to drive the next step in your process without human intervention.

This automation dramatically reduces labor and errors in handling documents. Employees are freed from rote paperwork to focus on higher-value tasks, while the AI handles the heavy lifting at high speed. For example, in one deployment approximately 85% of incoming documents were processed automatically, virtually **eliminating data entry errors** and bottlenecks. The result is faster turnaround times, more reliable information, and a workflow that scales effortlessly with volume.

## How It Works

**OCR and AI Extraction:** At the core of IDP is a pipeline that “reads” and understands your documents. It begins with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to convert scanned images or PDFs into machine-readable text. On top of OCR, Cerebello deploys ML models to interpret the content – identifying document types, key fields, and context. Whether it’s a structured form with fixed fields or an unstructured contract with paragraphs of text, the AI can recognize names, dates, totals, addresses, and dozens of other data points with a high degree of accuracy. NLP techniques allow the system to comprehend language and context in more complex documents (for instance, extracting obligations from a legal contract or line items from an invoice). The IDP system continuously learns from new data and feedback, so extraction becomes even more accurate over time.

**Seamless Integration and Workflow Automation:** Once data is extracted, the platform doesn’t stop there – it automatically injects the structured information into your existing workflows and software. Cerebello’s IDP solution can **integrate with legacy systems and enterprise platforms** like ERP, CRM, or document management systems so that captured data flows where it’s needed with no manual rekeying. For example, when staff scan incoming paperwork, an AI-powered module instantly extracts the data and populates it into the company’s logistics and finance systems, **eliminating duplicate data entry**. The platform can trigger business rules or next steps (e.g. initiating an approval process or updating a customer record) as soon as the info is available. Importantly, the system handles exceptions prudently – if certain inputs are unclear or confidence is low, the IDP flags them for human review, so you maintain control over quality. All of this happens within seconds, enabling round-the-clock processing. The net effect is a faster, smarter document workflow that plays nicely with your IT environment instead of adding complexity.

## Key Use Cases

IDP is a versatile capability with **broad applications across industries**. Some representative use cases include:

- **Healthcare:** Hospitals and clinics can digitize patient intake forms, insurance claims, and medical records for faster administration and fewer errors. For example, one healthcare clinic used automation to transfer patient billing data between systems – **processing errors dropped to near zero and staff reclaimed 40% of their day to focus on patient care**. By using IDP to handle forms and paperwork, healthcare providers speed up admissions and billing while allowing medical staff to spend more time on patient needs rather than paperwork.

- **Logistics & Shipping:** Logistics companies deal with mountains of shipping documents, bills of lading, delivery forms, and customs paperwork. Cerebello’s IDP service can rapidly read these scanned documents and extract key details (dates, tracking numbers, fees, addresses, etc.) into the company’s database **without manual data entry**. In one case, a freight provider implemented an IDP solution that automatically processed the bulk of incoming shipping forms end-to-end, drastically cutting data entry time and ensuring information was entered correctly into their cargo tracking system. This not only accelerates cargo processing and clearance but also reduces costly mistakes in supply chain paperwork.

- **Public Sector:** Government agencies and public sector organizations streamline citizen services with IDP. A great example is automating permit and application processing – instead of clerks manually reviewing every form, an AI system can scan incoming applications, validate that all required fields and documents are present, and even evaluate criteria for approval. One city government used IDP to handle building permit applications and **cut the processing time by 50%** by automatically checking forms for completeness and routing them to the right officers. Routine cases were approved much faster, allowing officials to focus only on the complex cases and improving service to citizens.

- **Financial Services:** Banks, insurers, and accounting teams process countless documents such as loan applications, insurance claims, and vendor invoices. IDP can automatically extract and validate data from these forms to speed up decision-making and record-keeping. For instance, in the insurance sector Cerebello helped a carrier automate its claims intake – the system reads claim documents and verifies key information against policy rules, eliminating manual paperwork steps. In one engagement, an insurance company introduced AI to handle document verification in their claims workflow, removing redundant manual checks and thereby accelerating claim approvals. Likewise, finance departments use IDP to capture data from invoices and receipts into ERP systems, which improves accuracy in accounts payable and lets analysts focus on exceptions or strategic tasks instead of typing up numbers.

_(These are just a few examples – virtually any process that relies on forms or documents can benefit from IDP, from analyzing legal contracts to onboarding new employees with HR forms.)_

## Implementation Process

Cerebello delivers IDP solutions through a structured end-to-end process to ensure a successful deployment and adoption:

1. **Discovery & Planning:** We begin with a thorough discovery phase to understand your current document workflows, volumes, and pain points. Our consultants map out how information flows through your organization and identify high-impact opportunities for automation. We work closely with your team to define requirements and success metrics for the project (e.g. target accuracy rates or time savings). By the end of this phase, we have a clear roadmap and business case aligned with your goals.

2. **Pilot Program:** Next, we prove the value on a small scale. Cerebello will implement a pilot IDP solution on a limited scope – for example, processing one type of document or deploying in a single department – as a real-world test. This pilot allows us to validate the technology in your environment and fine-tune it with user feedback. Stakeholders get to see early results firsthand, and any adjustments needed are made before a full rollout. The pilot builds confidence and ensures the solution truly works for your business case.

3. **Full Rollout:** With a successful pilot and stakeholder buy-in, we scale up to a full deployment. Cerebello’s team will integrate the IDP solution across the necessary business units, document types, and IT systems.
