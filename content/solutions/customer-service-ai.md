# Customer Service AI

## Overview

Cerebello’s **Customer Service AI** solution enhances how organizations engage with their customers, citizens, or users by combining natural language processing (NLP), AI-powered chatbots, generative AI, and intelligent triage systems into a cohesive support experience. Whether it’s answering customer questions, assisting employees, or handling citizen inquiries, our AI solutions reduce support volumes, accelerate response times, and **elevate satisfaction** – all while ensuring human oversight, regulatory compliance, and seamless system integration.

Our approach is **human-centered and outcome-driven**. We design AI-powered support agents that understand your workflows, speak your brand’s voice, and integrate deeply into your knowledge base, CRM, or internal systems. From instantly answering FAQs to helping agents resolve complex tickets faster, our Customer Service AI can transform both internal efficiency and the external user experience. And with **on-premise deployment options**, your data stays secure – a necessity for public sector and highly regulated environments.

## Capabilities

Our Customer Service AI offering includes:

- **AI-Powered Chatbots & Virtual Assistants:** Conversational bots that handle repetitive questions 24/7 – such as billing inquiries, appointment scheduling, or order status – across channels like web chat, WhatsApp, and email.
- **Intelligent Triage & Routing:** Automatically classify incoming requests, assess urgency and sentiment, and assign tickets to the right agent or team. This improves response prioritization and reduces resolution time.
- **Suggested Replies & Knowledge Assistance:** Using generative AI, our system proposes accurate, brand-aligned responses based on internal knowledge, past tickets, and user history. Agents save time and provide more consistent answers.
- **Conversation Summarization:** Summarize long threads into key points and action items for faster handoffs and better cross-team collaboration.
- **Sentiment & Intent Analysis:** Understand the tone and purpose of a message – flag urgent issues, identify dissatisfied customers, or escalate based on emotional signals.
- **Multilingual Capabilities:** Handle conversations in multiple languages automatically, improving accessibility and user reach.

All capabilities are **customized to your processes** – not just generic AI tools, but solutions fine-tuned for your workflows, terminology, and compliance needs.

## Use Cases Across Industries

Our Customer Service AI solutions have delivered value in:

- **Public Sector:** Municipalities have deployed AI chatbots to field thousands of citizen questions (e.g., waste schedules, permit applications) – freeing up staff and improving accessibility. In one case, a bilingual chatbot handled citizen inquiries 24/7, reducing the volume of calls and in-person visits while boosting satisfaction【7†source】.
- **Healthcare:** Clinics use AI assistants to answer patient FAQs (e.g., appointment times, insurance questions) and route clinical requests to the right teams. This allows medical staff to focus on care, not calls.
- **Telecom & Utilities:** Automated agents help customers check bills, update accounts, or troubleshoot issues instantly. Sentiment analysis flags angry messages for fast intervention.
- **Ecommerce & Retail:** Customer support bots help users with order tracking, returns, and promotions. Generative AI suggests tailored responses based on past order history and FAQs.
- **Legal & Enterprise Services:** Internal help desks use AI to answer policy questions and guide staff to resources. AI agents summarize prior ticket history for handovers or escalation.

**Samsung Case Study:** In a multi-departmental rollout, Cerebello helped Samsung implement on-premise AI customer service tools. In the customer support department, AI classified emails by topic and sentiment, generated response drafts, and routed queries to the appropriate team. This reduced manual triage time and helped agents respond 50% faster, resulting in better consistency and higher customer satisfaction【8†source】.

## Delivery Approach

Cerebello follows an end-to-end delivery process to ensure each AI assistant fits your needs:

1. **Discovery & Planning:** We run collaborative workshops to understand support workflows, volumes, tone-of-voice, escalation rules, and integration points.
2. **Prototype & Pilot:** We launch a pilot AI agent in a focused area (e.g. one channel or department). Early results help fine-tune intents, responses, and triage logic.
3. **Full Deployment & Integration:** We roll out the AI solution across channels and integrate with your tools (e.g. ticketing systems, CRM, knowledge bases). Whether SaaS or on-premise, we ensure seamless connectivity.
4. **Training & Change Management:** We prepare support teams with documentation, train-the-trainer sessions, and transition plans. We emphasize co-working with AI, not replacement.
5. **Ongoing Optimization:** Post-launch, we monitor accuracy, feedback, and satisfaction scores. We refine the AI with real data and scale it to other domains or languages.
